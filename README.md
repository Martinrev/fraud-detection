## Description:

This project aims to explore the challenges of learning in an imbalanced data context, with a specific application to fraud detection. 
The data used comes from real sources, including a large retail chain and certain banking institutions (FNCI and Banque de France).

The analyzed transactions cover a period of 10 months, from "2017-02-01" to "2017-11-30," and represent check payments made in stores across France for a large retail chain. The dataset consists of 23 variables and 4,646,773 rows. One of the main challenges of this project lies in the imbalanced nature of the target variable "FlagImpaye." This binary variable indicates whether a transaction is accepted (0) or considered fraudulent (1). Only 0.649% of transactions are labeled as fraudulent, requiring a specific methodology to address this imbalance.

In the field of fraudulent check detection, the practical application of our work can be observed through the implementation of an algorithm within various financial institutions. This algorithm aims to automate the verification process of deposited checks by analyzing various transmitted variables, such as the deposit date, check amount, or customer profile, with the goal of identifying and recovering fraudulent checks.
